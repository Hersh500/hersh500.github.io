We developed a planning algorithm with an affine approximation of the single rigid body dynamics model, and improved the accuracy of this model by online learning of residuals to the approximation. We analyzed how perception error could affect controller performance by perturbing the switching time of the hybrid robot dynamics, and how online dynamics learning might aid in recovering from this error.
